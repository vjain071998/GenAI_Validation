Here is the output in JSON list:

[
  {
    "scenario_id": "Base Case",
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Expected pricing output"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 1,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Pricing output decreased, as expected"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 2,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Pricing output increased, as expected"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 3,

  },
  {

    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Pricing output decreased, as expected"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 8,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Pricing output decreased, as expected"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 9,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Pricing output decreased, as expected"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 10,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Pricing output decreased, as expected"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 11,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Pricing output decreased, as expected"
  }
]

Note: For each scenario, I compared the bumped value with the base case and checked whether the pricing output behaves logically. As a quantitative finance validator, I expect the pricing output to decrease when sigma increases (since options become less valuable due to increased volatility) and vice versa. All scenarios passed this test.
