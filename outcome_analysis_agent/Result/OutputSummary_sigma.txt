Here is the output in JSON format:

[
  {
    "scenario_id": "Base Case",
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Expected pricing output for base case"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 1,
    "verdict": "Fail",
    "reason": "Pricing output decreased due to lower volatility, but the option type is call, so it should increase"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 2,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Pricing output increased as expected with slightly higher volatility"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 3,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Pricing output increased further as expected with slightly higher volatility"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 4,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Pricing output continued to increase as expected with higher volatility"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 5,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Pricing output increased further as expected with higher volatility"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 6,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Pricing output returned to base case value, indicating that the original volatility is the maximum price for this option"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 7,
    "verdict": "Fail",
    "reason": "Pricing output decreased due to slightly higher volatility, which should not happen for a call option"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 8,
    "verdict": "Fail",
    "reason": "Pricing output continued to decrease with higher volatility, which is unexpected for a call option"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 9,
    "verdict": "Fail",
    "reason": "Pricing output decreased further with higher volatility, which is not expected for a call option"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 10,
    "verdict": "Fail",
    "reason": "Pricing output continued to decrease with higher volatility, which is unexpected for a call option"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 11,
    "verdict": "Fail",
    "reason": "Pricing output decreased further with higher volatility, which is not expected for a call option"
  }
]

Note: The verdicts are based on the assumption that the pricing output should increase as the volatility increases for a call option.
