Here is the output in JSON list format:

[
  { "scenario_id": 1, "verdict": "Fail", "reason": "Pricing output is lower than base case, which does not make sense for a call option with decreasing interest rate" },
  { "scenario_id": 2, "verdict": "Pass", "reason": "Pricing output is higher than base case, as expected for a call option with increasing interest rate" },
  { "scenario_id": 3, "verdict": "Pass", "reason": "Pricing output is higher than base case, as expected for a call option with increasing interest rate" },
  { "scenario_id": 4, "verdict": "Pass", "reason": "Pricing output is higher than base case, as expected for a call option with increasing interest rate" },
  { "scenario_id": 5, "verdict": "Pass", "reason": "Pricing output is higher than base case, as expected for a call option with increasing interest rate" },
  { "scenario_id": 6, "verdict": "Pass", "reason": "Pricing output is higher than base case, as expected for a call option with increasing interest rate" }
]

Note: The verdict is FAIL for the first scenario because the pricing output decreases when the interest rate decreases, which does not make sense for a call option. For the other scenarios, the verdict is PASS because the pricing output increases when the interest rate increases, as expected for a call option.
