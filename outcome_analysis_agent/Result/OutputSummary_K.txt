Here is the output in JSON list format:

[
  {
    "scenario_id": 1,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "The pricing output decreases as expected when K is lowered."
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 2,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "The pricing output decreases as expected when K is slightly increased from the base case."
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 3,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "The pricing output continues to decrease as expected when K is further increased."
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 4,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "The pricing output decreases as expected when K is slightly increased from the previous scenario."
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 5,
    "verdict": "Don't know",
    "reason": "The pricing output is the same as the base case, which may not be logical given that K has been changed."
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 6,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "The pricing output decreases as expected when K is increased from the previous scenario."
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 7,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "The pricing output continues to decrease as expected when K is further increased."
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 8,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "The pricing output decreases as expected when K is slightly increased from the previous scenario."
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 9,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "The pricing output continues to decrease as expected when K is further increased."
  }
]

Note: The verdict for scenario 5 is "Don't know" because the pricing output is the same as the base case, which may not be logical given that K has been changed.
