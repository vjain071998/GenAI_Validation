Here is the output in JSON list format:

[
  {
    "scenario_id": 1,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Bumped value lower than base case and behaves logically as a call option"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 2,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Bumped value higher than base case and behaves logically as a call option"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 3,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Bumped value higher than base case and behaves logically as a call option"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 4,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Bumped value higher than base case and behaves logically as a call option"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 5,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Bumped value same as base case, which is logical for a call option with strike price equal to the underlying price"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 6,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Bumped value higher than base case and behaves logically as a call option"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 7,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Bumped value higher than base case and behaves logically as a call option"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 8,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Bumped value higher than base case and behaves logically as a call option"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 9,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Bumped value higher than base case and behaves logically as a call option"
  }
]

Note: As the option type is 'call', we expect the pricing output to decrease when the underlying price decreases (S0 < 100) and increase when the underlying price increases (S0 > 100). This behavior matches our expectations, so all scenarios are marked as "Pass".
