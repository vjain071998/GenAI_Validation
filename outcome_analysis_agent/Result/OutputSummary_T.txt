Here is the output in JSON list:

    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Bumped value is lower than base case as expected for a call option with reduced time to expiration"
  },

Note: The verdicts are based on the assumption that the pricing output behaves logically, which means it should decrease when T decreases and increase when T increases.
