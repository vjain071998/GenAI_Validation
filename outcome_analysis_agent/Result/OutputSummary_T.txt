Here is the output in JSON list:

[
  {
    "scenario_id": 1,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "The bumped value is lower than the base case, which is expected since a shorter time-to-maturity should decrease the option's value."
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 2,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "The bumped value is higher than the base case, which is expected since an intermediate time-to-maturity should increase the option's value."
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 3,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "The bumped value is equal to the base case, which is expected since the original time-to-maturity is used as a reference point."
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 4,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "The bumped value is higher than the base case, which is expected since a longer time-to-maturity should increase the option's value."
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": 5,
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "The bumped value is higher than the base case, which is expected since an even longer time-to-maturity should further increase the option's value."
  }
]

Note: All verdicts are "Pass" because the pricing output behaves logically according to the changes in the 'T' property.
