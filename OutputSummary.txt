Here is the output in JSON list:

[
  { "scenario_id": 1, "verdict": "Pass", "reason": "Pricing output decreases as expected with increasing S0" },
  { "scenario_id": 2, "verdict": "Pass", "reason": "Pricing output continues to decrease with increasing S0" },
  { "scenario_id": 3, "verdict": "Pass", "reason": "Pricing output continues to decrease with increasing S0" },
  { "scenario_id": 4, "verdict": "Pass", "reason": "Pricing output continues to decrease with increasing S0" },
  { "scenario_id": 5, "verdict": "Fail", "reason": "Pricing output becomes non-physical (negative)" },
  { "scenario_id": 6, "verdict": "Don't know", "reason": "No logical behavior can be inferred without more information about the pricing model" },
  { "scenario_id": 7, "verdict": "Fail", "reason": "Pricing output becomes non-physical (negative)" },
  { "scenario_id": 8, "verdict": "Don't know", "reason": "No logical behavior can be inferred without more information about the pricing model" },
  { "scenario_id": 9, "verdict": "Fail", "reason": "Pricing output becomes non-physical (negative)" }
]

Note: As a quantitative finance validator, I'm assuming that the pricing output should behave logically and physically (i.e., stay positive) as S0 increases.
