Here is the output in JSON list:

[
  {
    "scenario_id": "1",
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Pricing output decreases as expected when underlying price decreases"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": "2",
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Pricing output increases as expected when underlying price increases"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": "3",
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Pricing output increases further as expected when underlying price increases more"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": "4",
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Pricing output continues to increase as expected when underlying price increases even more"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": "5",
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Pricing output returns to original value as expected when underlying price is restored to the base case"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": "6",
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Pricing output increases further as expected when underlying price increases even more"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": "7",
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Pricing output continues to increase as expected when underlying price increases even more"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": "8",
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Pricing output continues to increase as expected when underlying price increases even more"
  },
  {
    "scenario_id": "9",
    "verdict": "Pass",
    "reason": "Pricing output is at its maximum as expected when the underlying price is significantly higher than the strike price"
  }
]

Note that all verdicts are "Pass" because the pricing output behaves logically and consistently with changes in the underlying price.
