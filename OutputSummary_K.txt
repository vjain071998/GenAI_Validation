Here is the JSON list of verdicts:

[
  { 
    "scenario_id": "Base Case", 
    "verdict": "Pass", 
    "reason": "Expected pricing output matches base case" 
  },
  { 
    "scenario_id": 1, 
    "verdict": "Fail", 
    "reason": "Pricing output increases as K decreases (logical inconsistency)" 
  },
  { 
    "scenario_id": 2, 
    "verdict": "Pass", 
    "reason": "Expected pricing output decreases as K increases" 
  },
  { 
    "scenario_id": 3, 
    "verdict": "Pass", 
    "reason": "Pricing output decreases as K increases (logical consistency)" 
  },
  { 
    "scenario_id": 4, 
    "verdict": "Pass", 
    "reason": "Expected pricing output continues to decrease as K increases" 
  },
  { 
    "scenario_id": 5, 
    "verdict": "Pass", 
    "reason": "Pricing output matches base case (K is unchanged)" 
  },
  { 
    "scenario_id": 6, 
    "verdict": "Fail", 
    "reason": "Pricing output decreases as K increases (logical inconsistency)" 
  },
  { 
    "scenario_id": 7, 
    "verdict": "Pass", 
    "reason": "Expected pricing output continues to decrease as K increases" 
  },
  { 
    "scenario_id": 8, 
    "verdict": "Pass", 
    "reason": "Pricing output decreases as K increases (logical consistency)" 
  },
  { 
    "scenario_id": 9, 
    "verdict": "Pass", 
    "reason": "Expected pricing output continues to decrease as K increases" 
  }
]

Note that I'm assuming a call option, which means the expected behavior is for the pricing output to increase when K decreases and decrease when K increases. If this assumption is incorrect, please let me know and I'll revise my verdicts accordingly.
